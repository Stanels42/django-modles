Lab 27. Practice Django Models

## About
The goal of this assignment is to farther practice creating a Django server. For this lab in particular the goal was to use models to be able to store some data within the site it's self. The other half was to get used to creating static files. In this case it was creating and importing CSS files onto the pages it's self.

## Requirements
Create a server with at least 2 views
1) List the model view
    - Dynamically populated
2) Detail View<br>
Create a model for saving data<br>
Import some files of basic CSS

##### Personal Note
This was created more for personal reference but I need to get back in the habit of committing more often. I was more on top of it during 301 and just need to build up the habit again.
